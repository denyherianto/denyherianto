# Hi, I’m Deny 👋

Senior Frontend Engineer focused on **AI-powered products, complex UI systems, and real-world scale**.

I build interfaces where **latency, trust, and clarity** matter — especially for **LLM-driven experiences**, internal tools, and data-heavy applications. My work sits between frontend architecture, AI interaction design, and pragmatic system thinking shaped by production constraints.

---

## 🧠 What I work on

- **LLM-powered chat & copilot UIs**  
  Streaming responses (SSE), non-blocking UX, context-aware follow-ups, error recovery, and rich output rendering (Markdown, KaTeX).

- **Large-scale frontend systems**  
  React / Next.js apps serving millions of users with performance, accessibility, and testability as first-class concerns.

- **Product & platform engineering**  
  Reusable UI systems, shared patterns, and tooling teams actually adopt.

- **Applied AI experiments**  
  Multi-agent pipelines, confidence heuristics, and human-in-the-loop workflows where correctness matters.

## 🚀 Selected Work

### 🤖 LLM Chat Copilot (Production)
Led frontend architecture for a real-time AI copilot used by **7K+ daily active users**.  
Designed streaming UX, latency-aware interactions, robust error handling, and explainable outputs to balance speed, clarity, and user trust.

**Stack:** React, TypeScript, SSE, Markdown, KaTeX

### 🌍 Disaster Pulse (2025)
Real-time disaster intelligence platform aggregating government, social, news, and user signals.

- Multi-agent AI reasoning with spatiotemporal clustering
- Confidence scoring to reduce false positives
- Human-in-the-loop verification
- Live geospatial dashboard for safety-critical use cases

**Stack:** Next.js, NestJS, Gemini API, Redis, BullMQ, PostgreSQL, FCM

---

### 📍 Geocoding & Shipping Tool (Hackathon → Production)
Built a geocoding system that reduced **Google Maps API usage by 90%** and won **1st place** in Bukalapak’s internal hackathon.  
Later adopted into the core platform due to clear business impact.
