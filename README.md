# Hey, I’m Deny 👋

Senior Frontend Engineer who enjoys turning **complex systems into interfaces people actually trust**.

I spend most of my time building **AI-powered products**, large-scale frontend platforms, and internal tools that quietly carry a lot of responsibility. If an interface has to stay calm while the system behind it is doing something complicated or slow, that’s my comfort zone.

## 🧩 Things I like building

- **LLM chat & copilot UIs**  
  Streaming responses, non-blocking UX, context-aware follow-ups, graceful failures, and outputs that explain themselves instead of hallucinating confidently.

- **Big frontends with small regrets**  
  React / Next.js apps used by millions, designed to stay fast, testable, and understandable six months later.

- **Tools teams keep using**  
  Shared UI systems, internal dashboards, and developer tools that don’t need a meeting to explain.

- **AI experiments with guardrails**  
  Multi-agent pipelines, confidence heuristics, and human-in-the-loop flows where correctness beats cleverness.

## 🚀 A few things I’ve shipped

### 🤖 AI Chat Copilot (Production)
Frontend lead for a real-time AI copilot used by **7K+ daily users**.

Designed streaming UX (SSE), latency-aware interactions, error recovery, and rich output rendering (Markdown, KaTeX) so users feel informed, not confused, while the model thinks.

**Stack:** React, TypeScript, SSE

### 🌍 Disaster Pulse
A real-time disaster intelligence platform that merges government data, social signals, news, and human input into high-confidence alerts.

Under the hood:
- Multi-agent AI reasoning
- Spatiotemporal clustering
- Confidence scoring to reduce false positives
- A live geospatial dashboard for safety-critical decisions

**Stack:** Next.js, NestJS, Gemini API, Redis, BullMQ

### 📍 Geocoding Tool (Hackathon → Core Platform)
Built a geocoding system that cut **Google Maps API usage by 90%**, won **1st place** in an internal hackathon, and was adopted into production because it saved real money.

---

### 🧪 Mock Studio
A Chrome DevTools extension for mocking HTTP APIs locally.

Intercept requests, fake responses, simulate delays, and even generate mocks with AI — so frontend work doesn’t have to wait for backend miracles.

## ✍️ I also write (because code isn’t enough)

I write about frontend engineering, system design, and AI-assisted development — mostly about **why tradeoffs exist**, not pretending they don’t.
